## Project Description

            ü¶Ñ   Welcome to the Island Ecosystem Simulation Project!  ü§ñüôâüê∑

This Java-based simulation project aims to realistically replicate an island environment populated by various animals and plants. The simulated creatures exhibit behavior such as feeding, reproduction, movement, and interaction within the ecosystem. The simulation focuses on implementing object-oriented programming principles to create a hierarchical structure for different species of animals, each with unique characteristics and behaviors.

### Key Features:
- **Animal Hierarchy:** Includes carnivores and herbivores with specific behaviors.
- **Multi-threaded Simulation:** Utilizes multi-threading for parallel execution of tasks involving plant growth, animal actions, and statistical monitoring.
- **Probability-based Interactions:** Models animal interactions such as predation based on defined probabilities for each species' feeding behavior.
- **Dynamic Environment:** Tracks animal feeding, reproduction, and movement, affecting the island's ecosystem dynamics.

### Implemented Classes:
- **Animal:** Abstract class representing common attributes and behaviors for all animals.
- **Specific Animal Classes:** Example classes like Lobo (Wolf), Conejo (Rabbit), Oso(Bear), Oruga(Caterpillar) etc., inheriting from the Animal class with specific behaviors and characteristics.
- **Celda (Cell):** Class to manage cells containing animals and plants in the island grid.

### Usage:
You can clone this repository to explore, modify, and run the Java simulation locally. Follow the provided documentation for instructions on running the simulation

### Contributions:
Contributions, suggestions, and bug reports are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.

### Future Enhancements:
- Visualization: Integrate graphical representations using JavaFX or other libraries.
- Additional Factors: Implement more factors influencing the ecosystem (e.g., weather, population density, hurricanes, etc.).
- More advnanced multithread improvements.
- Posibility to adjust parameters of the simulation.
